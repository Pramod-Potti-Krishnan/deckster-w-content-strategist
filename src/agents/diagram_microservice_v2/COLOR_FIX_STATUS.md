## Root Cause Analysis

The color mapping is still producing duplicates because:
1. The template colors are being mapped in order
2. Some template colors map to the same theme color
3. The complementary theme needs better color distribution logic

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **Quick Fix**: Modify the color mapping to use an index-based approach to guarantee unique colors for each element
2. **Better Fix**: Create element-specific color mappings (e.g., "q1_fill" -> specific color)
3. **Best Fix**: Implement a color assignment algorithm that tracks used colors and ensures uniqueness
